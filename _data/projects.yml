    Youth Time Diwali Special, All India Radio - Chandigarh, India
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Diwali is an annual festival in India that is celebrated across the country. Celebrations almost always involve fireworks. The aim of the programme was to educate the youth on the pollution and harm caused by the fireworks. My curiosity led to an oppurunity to co-host and co-script a Diwali Special for All India Radio, Chandigarh.
