    Fun Useful Information about Prague
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    [Places In Prague](https://placesinprague.com) is a digital magazine in its nascent form. It was born out of my own love for exploring hidden nooks and corners of a city. The site aims to show people places in prague that are not frequently visited by tourists. Built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) using [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) and hosted on [Git Hub](https://github.com/).

    Diwali is an annual festival in India that is celebrated across the country. Celebrations almost always involve firworks.

My curiosity led to an oppurunity to co-host and co-script a Diwali Special for All India Radio, Chandigarh.
