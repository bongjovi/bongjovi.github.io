    Youth Time Diwali Special, All India Radio - Chandigarh, India
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Diwali is an annual festival in India that is celebrated across the country. Celebrations almost always involve fireworks.

My curiosity led to an oppurunity to co-host and co-script a Diwali Special for All India Radio, Chandigarh. The show is in Hindi.
