  # Hi ! I am Atif.
  
   I am based in Prague and in search for an enthusiastic team to join. During my research for top places to work in Prague your firm's name came up. While I understand that there are many exciting positions on offer, I am interested in Account Management.
   Along with a rich experience in FMCG I bring along some of these skill sets

  While I am not busy watching films and reading, learing languages is always fun for me. Here are some of the languages that I try to speak:
  - English   - Advanced
  - Hindi     - Advanced
  - Czech     - Intermediate
  - Italian   - Beginner 
  - German    - Beginner
    
  
  Other than these things I enjoy spending time with my family and our dog. I am currently based in Prague and I am open to relocation to cities in Europe as on date.
