  While I am not busy watching films I try learning new languages. Here are some of the languages that I try to speak:
  - English   - Advanced
  - Hindi     - Advanced
  - Czech     - Upper Intermediate
  - Italian   - Beginner 
  
    
  
  Other than these things I enjoy spending time with my family and our dog.
