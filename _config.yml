  While I am not busy learning new things I like to read and watch movies and write stories that excite me. From all the new things that one can learn, I find *languages* really exciting. Here are some of the languages that I try to speak:
  - English
  - Hindi
  - Czech
  - Italian
  - German
    
  
  Other than these things I enjoy spending time with my family and our dog. I am currently based in Prague and I am open to relocation to cities only in Europe as on date.
