   I came across your website and I found it appealing. I got curious and began to ask, what would it be like to work there ?? Well, there is only one way of finding out. Which is by being part of your team.I believe that brands do not make people, people make brands. Some of the attributes that I bring to the team are 
   <mark>People Management</mark>
   <mark>Problem Solving</mark>,
   <mark>Analytical Thinking</mark>,
   <mark>Relationship Management</mark>,
   <mark>Marketing</mark>,<mark>Sales</mark>

  While I am not busy learning new things I like to read and watch movies and write stories that excite me. From all the new things that one can learn, I find *languages* really exciting. Here are some of the languages that I try to speak:
  - English   - Advanced
  - Hindi     - Advanced
  - Czech     - Intermediate
  - Italian   - Beginner 
  - German    - Beginner
    
  
  Other than these things I enjoy spending time with my family and our dog. I am currently based in Prague and I am open to relocation to cities in Europe as on date.
